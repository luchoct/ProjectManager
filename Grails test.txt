Project
-------
Build a simple grails application to manage project information.

Description
-----------
The application should allow a user to create/edit/delete/view projects.

A project has the following information:
	- project name (alphanumeric)
	- project code (alphanumeric)
	- tech lead (person's name)
	- project manager (person's name)
	- delivery date
	- current phase (one of briefing/scoping/interaction/development/qa/release)
	- priority (numerical)
	
The priority field goes from 1 (highest) upwards and is dependant on the number of projects (e.g. only one project is number 1 priority). 
Kind of like a 'top of the pops' list. 

Any list view should default to ordering by priority.

Extras
------
Think about demonstrating use of tests, maybe some TDD?
Also the architecture of the application, where should any business logic go?
